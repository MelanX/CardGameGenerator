# Card Game Generator
This generator is written in [Python](https://www.python.org/).
It's designed for the website [Mein Spiel](https://meinspiel.de/).

It will generate the following cards:
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6
- 7
- 8
- 9
- 10
- J
- Q
- K
- A

For now, only in German, so instead of J and Q, there will be B and D. 
Jokers are missing at the moment.

This generator will be rewritten in Java soon.
I think. We will see. It's planned at least.
